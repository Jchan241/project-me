        I'm a web-developer from the marvelous city of Melbourne Australia.
        Straight after completing my Business Information Systems degree at Monash University,
        I found myself a graduate position at NEC Australia. I was there for 18 months, completing 3 different rotations;
        Unified Communications Engineer, Service Desk Analyst and Windows System Engineer.
        While I was at NEC and in my last rotation, I was responsible for managing a variety of clients with their windows server and cloud infrastructure.
        This means working closely with clients to analyse and resolve their IT related issues as well as to maintain constant uptime for all IT infrastructure.
        This was my first job outside of university and it taught me a lot about working together to achieve a similar goal.
