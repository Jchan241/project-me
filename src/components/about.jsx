      <h2>So...more about me</h2>
      <p>
        I probably spend too much time on the computer, always have, since my first computer.
        <br />
        <br />
        I spent most my of teens playing online games, I would sit and play through the night and
        if it was not for school, probably through the day as well.
        <br />
        I've stopped playing games now though, instead, I contribute many many views to random youtube videos.

        While I was completing my Business Information Systems degree at Monash University,
        I was fortunate enough to land myself an Industry Based Learning Scholarship.
        This involved a 6 months placement at a leading Australian or gobal organisation.
        In my case, Australia Post. My main focus was conversion optimisationfor all
        digitial revenue generating products and services.

        Shortly after completing my degree, I found myself a graduate position at NEC Australia.
        I was there for 18 months, completing 3 different rotations;
        Unified Communications Engineer, Service Desk Analyst and Windows System Engineer.
        This was my first job outside of university and it taught me a lot about working together to achieve a similar goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        I recently graduated from Le Wagon and I really love coding.
        I am currently working on a few personal projects as well as freelancing while looking for a Junior Dev position.

// I'm a web-developer from the marvelous city of Melbourne Australia.
// From a young age, I've always loved technology, always wanted to understand how things worked.



// I have always probably spent too much time in front of the computer, got my first one when I was 8,
// it was a 15" compaq laptop and was heavier than I brick (yes, I did weigh it).
// Throughout my teens, if I wasn't out taking photos, I would spend most of my time
// online playing games or editing my photos.

// While I was completing my Business Information Systems degree at Monash University,
// I was fortunate enough to land myself an Industry Based Learning Scholarship.
// This involved a 6 months placement at a leading Australian or gobal organisation.
// In my case, Australia Post. I was placed in the Digital Channel and Innovations team, my main focus was conversion optimisation
// for all digitial revenue generating products and services. I was responsible for working together with stakeholders
// and developers to ultimately improve user experience and to generate additional revenue.
// This involved conducting A/B and multivariate testing and analysing the results for the viability
// for the implementation.

// Straight after completing my degree, I found myself a graduate position at NEC Australia. I was there for 18 months, completing 3 different rotations;
// Unified Communications Engineer, Service Desk Analyst and Windows System Engineer.
// While I was at NEC and in my last rotation, I was responsible for managing a variety of clients with their windows server and cloud infrastructure.
// This means working closely with clients to analyse and resolve their IT related issues as well as to maintain constant uptime for all IT infrastructure.
// This was my first job outside of university and it taught me a lot about working together to achieve a similar goal.
